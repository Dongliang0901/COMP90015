Proj1:
Using a client-server architecture, design and implement a multi-threaded server that allows concurrent clients to search the meaning(s) of a word, add a new word, and remove an existing word
Proj2:
Shared whiteboards allow multiple users to draw simultaneously on a canvas. There are multiple examples found on the Internet that support a range of features such as freehand drawing with the mouse, drawing lines and shapes such as circles and squares that can be moved and resized, and inserting text. In addition to these features, your implementation should include a simple chat window, that allows all the current users of the system to broadcast messages to each other.
